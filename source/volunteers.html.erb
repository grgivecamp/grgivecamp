        <p>For one weekend in November, we'll take on the technology wish lists of 15-20 non-profit organizations, and we're looking for about <strong>100-150</strong> volunteers, both technical and non-technical, to help us do it.</p>
        
        <p>Everyone is welcome to head home for the evenings but there are always the diehards who work from Friday kickoff straight through Sunday afternoon. Food and drinks, especially of the caffeinated variety, are provided, along with plenty of networking opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Technical volunteers</h2>
        <p>We're looking for a variety of skill-sets and talents. If you think you can help, you're skills are needed!</p>
        <ul class='check'>
          <li>graphic or UX designers</li>
          <li>back-end developers</li>
          <li>front-end developers</li>
          <li>project managers</li>
          <li>DBAs</li>
          <li>non-profit technical consultants </li>
          <li>web strategists</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Non-technical volunteers</h2>
        <p>Beyond the technology, there are many other aspects that make GiveCamp a success. We need non-technical volunteers to run errands, help with setting up and cleaning up, and everything in between. Whether you can offer a couple hours of your time or join GiveCamp for a couple days, your support is needed.</p>
